University Management System (Java + Swing + MySQL)
This is a full-fledged University Management System developed in Java using Swing and AWT for the GUI, and MySQL (phpMyAdmin) as the database. The project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and allows users to manage university data like students, teachers, courses, and finances via an interactive interface.

ðŸ”§ Developed using IntelliJ IDEA.

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project provides an interface and backend for a university to manage operations such as:

Managing students and teachers

Recording fees and salaries

Storing and retrieving data from a MySQL database

GUI interactions via Java Swing and AWT

It brings together front-end (Java GUI) and back-end (MySQL) logic in a modular, object-oriented way.

âœ¨ Features
Add/update/delete student and teacher records

Track fee payments and salary disbursements

Interactive GUI built with Java Swing and AWT

MySQL database integration using JDBC

Total income and expense tracking

Clean and modular OOP structure

ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation (private fields with getters/setters)

Abstraction (layered architecture)

Constructor Overloading

Object creation and method calls

Separation of concerns (GUI logic vs. business logic vs. database)
